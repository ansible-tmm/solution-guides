# Editing Conventions

## Use Direct Text Editing, Not Scripts

Always use the StrReplace tool (or other built-in IDE editing tools) to modify files. Never write Python scripts, shell one-liners, or `sed`/`awk` commands to batch-edit file contents — even when fixing many similar occurrences.

If there are multiple instances to fix, make multiple StrReplace calls. This keeps changes visible, reviewable, and reversible in the IDE.
